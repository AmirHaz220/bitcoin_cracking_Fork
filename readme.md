## üîß Technical Details

This project relies heavily on OpenCL for GPU parallelization and is structured with the following goals:

  

Minimize memory overhead by utilizing shared and constant memory regions.

  

Streamline cryptographic operations to eliminate unnecessary computational cycles.

# üöÄ Why So Fast?

Our tools use the smallest amount of memory possible. For example, for wallets, we work directly bit by bit instead of strings, ensuring efficiency.

The `sha256` function is designed to process only one byte at a time, saving processing resources and making the system lighter.

Our goal is to map trillions of Bitcoin wallets in just a few days. This code successfully processes the first 11 seeds, defining the last one using a checksum with 1 chance in 128 (not 2048).

We have optimized the maximum number of loops to make the code more fluid and efficient.

Before building our `pbkdf2 hmac sha512`, we precomputed `INNER_PAD` and `OUTER_PAD` to maximize efficiency.

## üìñ How It Works

1. **Efficiency with Bits and Bytes**:
   - Working directly with bits saves memory and improves performance.
   - Processing byte by byte reduces the overhead of string manipulation.

2. **Wallet Mapping**:
   - We reduced the search space by limiting the checksum to 1 in 128 combinations.
   - This is crucial for processing large volumes of wallets quickly.

3. **Precomputing Pads for PBKDF2**:
   - Precomputing `INNER_PAD` and `OUTER_PAD` avoids repetitive calculations.
   - The process becomes linear and faster.

4. **Optimized Loops**:
   - Reducing unnecessary cycles and optimizing parallelism (when possible) improves scalability.

Our code is designed to map Bitcoin wallets efficiently, making the most of the available resources.


1. Generate Mnemonic Seeds: Sequentially generates billions of BIP-39 mnemonic combinations in accordance with Bitcoin standards.

2. Checksum SHA-256 Hashing: Computes cryptographic hashes of the seeds using an optimized GPU kernel for unmatched speed.

3. Seed Validation and Derivation: Filters and processes valid seeds for further operations, such as deriving wallet addresses.

4. Address Comparison (Upcoming): Matches derived addresses with a clustered blockchain database for potential hits.
