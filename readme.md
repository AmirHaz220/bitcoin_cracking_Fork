Essa aqui é uma versão especialmente otimizada para fazer hash e pegar os últimos 6 palavras mnemonicas do Bitcoin.  A função compila e otimiza os cálculos sha256 e sha512 diretamente no processador evitando loops que não essenciais e otimizando a criptofia sem declarar funções adicionais e extras
  
  

 
 

### Features🌟

✅ Windows Application Management
Easily manage the tool through a Windows environment, ensuring seamless setup and operation. 

✅ Sequential Seed Generation
Implements a robust sequential algorithm to generate and iterate over billions of BIP-39 mnemonic combinations with high efficiency.

  
✅ Optimized GPU SHA-256 Kernel
Leverages OpenCL to maximize GPU computational capabilities for performing SHA-256 hashing, crucial for Bitcoin cryptographic validation.

  ❌ GPU-Accelerated SHA-512 and PBKDF2 Integration (In Progress)
Extending GPU optimization to include SHA-512 and PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2), essential components for deriving Bitcoin master keys from seeds.

❌ Seed Derivation and Blockchain Address Matching (Coming Soon). Adding a mechanism to compare derived wallet addresses with clustered blockchain data for practical validation and attack scenarios.

  
  
  
  

## 💡 Performance Highlights

Thanks to extensive kernel optimizations and strategic variable tuning, the tool achieves an astounding performance of:

  

**7 billions valid seeds per second** on a standard laptop with no dedicated GPU.

Potential scalability to far exceed this rate with high-end GPUs, taking full advantage of parallelism in cryptographic functions.

This performance is achieved through:

  

Efficient memory usage, leveraging OpenCL constant memory for key storage.

Streamlined hashing pipeline to minimize bottlenecks.

Modular architecture to allow future expansions.
